## Conscious Sensuality - Retreat

I warmly invite you to the retreat "Conscious Sensuality".  

Robert Silber from Hawaii is returning to the Czech Republic after many years!

In a safe and trusting environment, you will learn to distinguish what you truly want from what comes from external pressure or fear. You will discover how to embrace your truth and live in alignment with it.  
The program also includes rest, inner reflection, writing, and sharing experiences that will help you bring these insights into everyday life.  
The retreat is designed to strengthen your inner resilience, confidence, and ability to tune in to yourself and others.  
Because of this, you will experience a greater sense of safety and freedom in relationships, especially regarding your own intimacy.

- You will better understand and respect your boundaries.  
- You will be able to distinguish your real desires from shame.  
- You will be more resistant to manipulation and pressure to conform.

Robert and Katika will guide you on a practical and deep journey that will help you connect more with yourself and others. Together, you'll create a space for healthy, respectful relationships based on awareness, trust, and authenticity.

We will focus on three main areas:

- **Body Awareness**  
Through meditations and rituals, you will learn to better sense your body, feelings, and sensory experiences.


- **Emotional Awareness**  
You will learn to better understand your emotions, needs, and boundaries—and how to work with them consciously.


- **Conscious Communication**  
You will practice open feedback, joint decision-making, and recognizing your own desires in contact with others.

This workshop is held in English with translation into Czech.﻿
